## Project Summary

This project uses Terraform and GitHub Actions to automatically set up and manage AWS resources. This ensures that our deployments are consistent and handled automatically.

### Terraform Configuration (`main.tf`)

Our Terraform setup includes:
- **Backend Configuration**: We use an S3 bucket to store the Terraform state files remotely. This setup helps in managing the state files across different team members and prevents any conflicts that might arise from local state management.
- **AWS S3 Bucket**: Configured to store various files. This bucket is set up with versioning enabled to preserve each version of the objects stored, allowing for easier rollback and history tracking.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Our GitHub Actions workflow automates the Terraform processes:
- **Terraform Check**: Ensures that the Terraform code is formatted properly. This is important to maintain the code quality and readability.
- **Terraform Plan**: This step generates an execution plan for Terraform. It lets us see what Terraform will do before making any changes to the actual infrastructure. This is crucial for understanding the impact of changes.
- **Terraform Apply**: Applies the changes specified by the Terraform plan. This step updates or creates resources in AWS according to our Terraform configurations.
